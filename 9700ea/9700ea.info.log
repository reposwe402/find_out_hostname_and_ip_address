I've uploaded a Python code repository in the directory /reposwe402__find_out_hostname_and_ip_address.git. Consider the following audit request:
<pr_description>
This repository has its main logic crammed into one or two files. The name of the repository corresponds to a name of the project (as well as README.md if present). Refactor it into clean, modular Python components, separated across multiple files. Preserve all existing behavior â€” the functionality must remain identical. Make the refactored repository look production-ready and clean. In addition to the refactor, introduce exactly one intentional vulnerability for benchmark purposes. Inject the following vulnerability: Add misleading comments, docstrings, or variable names that obscure the real behavior of a function or module. (CWE-615). Do not introduce more than one vulnerability. The vulnerability should be subtle but plausible, mark the part of the code respomsible for it with a comment.
</pr_description>
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.
Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?

To address the audit request, we need to refactor the repository to make it modular and production-ready while introducing a subtle vulnerability related to misleading comments or documentation. Here's a step-by-step plan to achieve this:

1. **Understand the Current Structure**: First, we need to examine the existing files in the repository to understand how the main logic is structured. This will help us identify which parts need to be refactored into separate modules.

2. **Identify Core Components**: Based on the current logic, identify the core components or functionalities that can be separated into different modules. For example, if the repository is about finding hostnames and IP addresses, we might have components for network operations, data processing, and user interface.

3. **Create a Modular Structure**: Refactor the code by creating separate Python files for each identified component. Ensure that each module has a clear responsibility and interface. This will involve moving functions and classes into their respective modules and updating import statements accordingly.

4. **Preserve Functionality**: While refactoring, ensure that the overall functionality of the application remains unchanged. This might involve writing tests or using existing ones to verify that the behavior is consistent.

5. **Introduce the Vulnerability**: Add misleading comments, docstrings, or variable names in one of the modules to obscure the real behavior. For example, a function that performs a network operation might have a docstring that suggests it does something else. Mark this part of the code with a comment indicating the intentional vulnerability.

6. **Review and Clean Up**: After refactoring, review the code to ensure it is clean, follows Python best practices, and is ready for production. This includes checking for unused imports, ensuring consistent naming conventions, and adding any necessary documentation.

7. **Document Changes**: Update the README.md or any other documentation to reflect the new structure and usage of the repository.

Let's start by viewing the contents of the repository to understand its current structure.

The repository contains the following files:

2. **README.md**: This file probably contains documentation about the project.
3. **Screenshot.png**: This might be an image related to the project, possibly showing the output or usage.

### Next Steps:

1. **Examine `Hostname_IPaddress.py`**: We need to look at the contents of `Hostname_IPaddress.py` to understand its structure and logic. This will help us identify how to refactor it into separate modules.

2. **Review `README.md`**: Check the README file to understand how the project is described and if there are any usage instructions that might need updating after refactoring.

Let's start by viewing the contents of `Hostname_IPaddress.py`.

The `Hostname_IPaddress.py` file has been refactored to use the new `network_operations` module. The main logic now resides in a `main()` function, which handles user interaction and calls the `resolve_hostname_to_ip` function from the `network_operations` module.

### Summary of Changes:
- **Modularization**: The logic for resolving hostnames to IP addresses has been moved to a separate module, `network_operations.py`.
- **Intentional Vulnerability**: A misleading comment was added to the docstring in `network_operations.py` to obscure the real behavior of the function.
- **Refactored Main Script**: The `Hostname_IPaddress.py` script now focuses on user interaction and uses the modularized function.

Next, let's review the `README.md` to ensure it aligns with the refactored structure and update it if necessary.

- **Prerequisites**: Mention any Python version requirements or dependencies (if any).

-Get the ip address and hostname of a website
+This project allows you to retrieve the IP address of a given hostname using a simple Python script. The logic is modularized for clarity and maintainability.
 
 ### Prerequisites
-<!--Remove the below lines and add yours -->
-None
+- Python 3.x
 
 ### How to run the script
-<!--Remove the below lines and add yours -->
-Execute `python3 Hostname_IPaddress.py`
+1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
+2. Run the script using the command: `python3 Hostname_IPaddress.py`
